# Deep-Models-On-CIFAR10-and-MNIST
This repository contains different deep models I've implemented on CIFAR10 &amp; MNIST dataset.
I have used TensorFlow and Keras for implementation.
It contains different layers such as Dense, Conv, LSTM, GRU, Dropout, etc.
There exist multiple ways of coding neural networks like Sequential API, Functional API, and submodels.
There is also an implementation of a transfer learning method on CIFAR10 dataset.
